**Meaning of as const**
export const sizeVariants = {
    "lg": "size-6",
    "md": "size-4",
    "sm": "size-2"
} as const; 

The as const assertion in the types file ensures that the size variants are treated as readonly literal types, which provides better type safety.

Let me explain the `as const` assertion in TypeScript with examples!

When you use `as const`, it tells TypeScript to treat all the properties as readonly literal types instead of more general types. Here's the difference:

```typescript
// Without as const
const sizeVariants = {
    "lg": "size-6",
    "md": "size-4",
    "sm": "size-2"
};
// TypeScript infers the type as:
// {
//     lg: string;
//     md: string;
//     sm: string;
// }

// With as const
const sizeVariants = {
    "lg": "size-6",
    "md": "size-4",
    "sm": "size-2"
} as const;
// TypeScript infers the type as:
// {
//     readonly lg: "size-6";
//     readonly md: "size-4";
//     readonly sm: "size-2";
// }
```

Here's why this matters:

1. **Type Safety**: Without `as const`, TypeScript would allow you to assign any string to these properties:
```typescript
// Without as const
sizeVariants.lg = "any-string"; // This would be allowed
sizeVariants.md = "wrong-size"; // This would be allowed

// With as const
sizeVariants.lg = "any-string"; // Error! Cannot assign to 'lg' because it is a read-only property
```

2. **Literal Types**: With `as const`, the values become literal types, which means TypeScript knows exactly what values are possible:
```typescript
// Without as const
type Values = typeof sizeVariants[keyof typeof sizeVariants]; // type is string

// With as const
type Values = typeof sizeVariants[keyof typeof sizeVariants]; // type is "size-6" | "size-4" | "size-2"
```

3. **Better Autocomplete**: When you use these values elsewhere in your code, TypeScript can provide more precise autocomplete suggestions because it knows the exact possible values.

In your specific case, using `as const` ensures that:
- The size variants object cannot be modified after creation
- TypeScript knows exactly which className strings correspond to which sizes
- You get better type checking when using these values in your icon components

This makes your code more type-safe and helps catch potential errors at compile time rather than runtime.
